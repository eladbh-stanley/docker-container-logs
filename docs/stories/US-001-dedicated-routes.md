# User Story: Dedicated Routes for Dashboard Sections

## Story ID  
US-001  

## Priority & Effort  
- Priority: High  
- Effort Estimate: Medium (3-4 hours)  

## Description  
As a dashboard user, I want each section (summaries, search, ask) to have its own route (e.g., /dashboard/summaries, /dashboard/search, /dashboard/ask) so that I can navigate directly, bookmark, or share specific views without relying on tabs.  

This supports easy access, aligning with the goal of making the app intuitive for quick debugging.  

## Acceptance Criteria  
- Create dynamic Next.js routes for summaries, search, and ask sections.  
- Update navigation components (e.g., tabs or links) to use Next.js router.push for transitions.  
- Ensure browser history (back/forward) works correctly across routes.  
- Handle URL parameters (e.g., pre-fill search query on /dashboard/search?q=error).  
- Maintain authentication checks on each route, redirecting to login if needed.  
- Test: Direct URL access loads the correct section without full page reloads.  

## Dependencies  
- Existing dashboard code in `website/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.  
- Next.js routing documentation (app router).  
- Potential: Update any global nav or auth hooks.  

## Additional Notes  
- This is foundational; implement before chat enhancements to avoid rework.  
- Consider SEO/bookmarking benefits, but since it's a dashboard, focus on internal UX.  
- Risks: Route conflicts if existing paths overlap â€“ audit current app structure.  

## Status  
- Not Started
