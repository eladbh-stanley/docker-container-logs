# Story 1.2 – Gemini Summarisation & Persistence

**Status:** Ready for Dev

## Story Statement
As a **developer on-call**, I want each emitted log chunk summarised by Gemini and stored with cost/usage metrics so that I can later review concise TL;DRs and track LLM spend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Worker consumes chunks from internal queue (< 100 ms hand-off).
2. Prompt template produces: a) “What happened” (≤ 100 chars); b) key events list; c) open questions.
3. Retry policy: 3 exponential back-offs (1 s → 8 s) on 429/5xx, then mark chunk **failed**.
4. SQLite table `summaries` created with FK to `chunks` using better-sqlite3; schema matches Architecture doc.
5. Token usage & USD cost persisted per call.
6. Circuit-breaker trips for 5 consecutive failures; health probe shows `summariser_unhealthy`.
7. Prometheus metrics: `gemini_request_seconds_histogram`, `gemini_tokens_total`, `gemini_cost_usd_total`.
8. Integration test stubs Gemini and verifies summary JSON structure + DB insert.

## Dev Notes
* Gemini SDK: Use @google/generative-ai npm package following async/await patterns
* Database: better-sqlite3 with prepared statements for performance
* Metrics: prom-client for Prometheus integration with Fastify /metrics endpoint  
* Circuit breaker: Custom implementation using Node.js timers and event emitters
* Testing: vitest with @google/generative-ai mocking for integration tests

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] (AC 1) Implement async consumer that reads from chunk queue.
2. [x] (AC 2) Build prompt template & call Gemini SDK; parse structured response.
3. (AC 3, 6) Add retry with back-off and circuit-breaker; expose `/health` flag.
4. (AC 4, 5) Define database models using better-sqlite3; create schema.
5. (AC 7) Expose Prometheus metrics using prom-client; add to `/metrics` endpoint.
6. (AC 8) Write integration tests with vitest mocking Gemini; assert DB rows & metric increments.

## Dev Agent Record

### File List
- src/summariser.js - Main summariser worker with chunk consumer and circuit breaker
- src/gemini.js - Gemini AI client with structured prompt template and response parsing
- test/summariser.test.js - Comprehensive test suite for summariser components
- test/gemini.test.js - Complete test suite for Gemini AI client

### Change Log
- Created ChunkConsumer class with async queue processing, < 100ms hand-off performance
- Created GeminiSummariser class with circuit breaker and health monitoring
- Implemented GeminiClient with structured prompt template producing: what_happened (≤100 chars), key_events, open_questions
- Added robust JSON response parsing with validation and 100-character truncation
- Integrated token usage tracking and USD cost calculation for Gemini API calls
- Implemented comprehensive test suites: 17 tests for summariser, 13 tests for Gemini client

## Project Structure Notes
Creates new modules: `src/summariser.js`, `src/gemini.js`, `src/models.js` following established Node.js patterns from Story 1.1. Uses winston logger with emoji prefixes matching existing conventions.

## Checklist Results
Pending execution of story-draft checklist.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-16
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Overall Assessment
The implementation for **Tasks 1 & 2** demonstrates excellent Node.js engineering practices with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and clean architecture. The code quality is production-ready for the completed portions.

### Code Quality Assessment ✅
**Strengths:**
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with ChunkConsumer, GeminiSummariser, and GeminiClient classes
- **Event-Driven Design**: Excellent use of EventEmitter for decoupled communication patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks throughout, proper error propagation and logging
- **Structured Logging**: Winston logger with emoji prefixes and correlation IDs following project conventions
- **Testing Excellence**: 30 tests total with 100% pass rate, including edge cases and error scenarios
- **Performance Compliance**: < 100ms hand-off requirement met using setTimeout(0) for async processing
- **Type Safety**: Proper input validation and JSON schema compliance checking

**Technical Highlights:**
- Circuit breaker pattern implemented correctly (5 failure threshold, 5-minute reset)
- Queue management with overflow protection (1000 item limit)
- Gemini response validation with 100-character truncation on what_happened field
- Token usage tracking and USD cost calculation integrated
- 30-second timeout protection on Gemini API calls using Promise.race

### Security Assessment ✅
**Dependency Vulnerabilities**: 
- **MODERATE** risk found in devDependency `esbuild` via `vitest` chain
- **Impact**: Only affects development/testing environment, not production runtime
- **Recommendation**: Consider `npm audit fix --force` after Story 1.2 completion to update vitest to v3.x

**Code Security**: No security issues identified in source code - proper API key handling, input validation, and no console.log leakage.

### Testing Coverage Assessment ✅
**Test Statistics:**
- **40 total tests** across 3 files: collector.test.js (10), summariser.test.js (17), gemini.test.js (13)
- **100% pass rate** with comprehensive coverage including:
  - Unit tests for all classes and methods
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Performance validation (< 100ms requirement)
  - Mock integrations for Google Generative AI
  - Circuit breaker behavior validation
  - Queue management and overflow scenarios

### Outstanding Work (Tasks 3-6) ⚠️
**Critical TODOs Identified:**
1. **src/summariser.js:174-176**: Retry logic, database storage, and metrics incomplete
2. **Missing src/models.js**: Database schema implementation not yet created per Architecture doc
3. **Retry Logic (Task 3)**: 3 exponential back-offs (1s → 8s) for 429/5xx errors not implemented
4. **Database Integration (Task 4)**: SQLite schema creation and persistence layer missing
5. **Prometheus Metrics (Task 5)**: prom-client integration for `/metrics` endpoint not implemented
6. **Integration Testing (Task 6)**: End-to-end tests with database and metrics validation needed

### Compliance with Story Requirements
**Completed (Tasks 1-2):**
- ✅ **AC 1**: Worker consumes chunks from internal queue (< 100 ms hand-off)
- ✅ **AC 2**: Prompt template produces required JSON structure with validation
- ✅ **AC 6**: Circuit-breaker implementation for 5 consecutive failures

**Pending (Tasks 3-6):**
- ⚠️ **AC 3**: Retry policy with exponential back-off not implemented
- ⚠️ **AC 4**: SQLite table `summaries` creation missing
- ⚠️ **AC 5**: Token usage & USD cost persistence incomplete
- ⚠️ **AC 7**: Prometheus metrics integration missing
- ⚠️ **AC 8**: Integration tests with database validation needed

### Recommendations for Completion
1. **Priority 1**: Implement database models and schema (src/models.js) matching Architecture doc
2. **Priority 2**: Add retry logic with exponential back-off in GeminiClient
3. **Priority 3**: Integrate prom-client metrics collection and /metrics endpoint
4. **Priority 4**: Create comprehensive integration tests with database validation
5. **Security**: Update vitest dependencies after story completion to resolve moderate vulnerabilities

### Architecture Compliance ✅
The implementation correctly follows the established patterns from Story 1.1:
- Proper file organization in `src/` directory
- Winston structured logging with emoji prefixes
- EventEmitter-based architecture
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Node.js ES modules with proper imports

**Verdict**: Tasks 1 & 2 are **production-ready** with excellent code quality. Tasks 3-6 require completion to fulfill all acceptance criteria.
