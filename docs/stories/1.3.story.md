# Story 1.3 – Query API & Follow-up Q&A

**Status:** Ready for Dev

## Story Statement
As an **operator**, I want a CLI/REST interface to list and search summaries and ask follow-up questions with context so that I can quickly diagnose incidents without raw-log digging.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Fastify on port **8000** with routes:
   • `GET /summaries?limit=&container=&from=&to=`
   • `GET /chunks/{id}` – returns raw chunk text
   • `POST /ask` body `{chunk_id?, question, from?, to?}` → Gemini answer.
2. yargs CLI commands mirror REST: `dlm list`, `dlm show <chunk_id>`, `dlm ask "...?"`.
3. JWT auth middleware validates `Authorization: Bearer` and CLI `--token`.
4. Follow-up Q&A call includes summary + raw chunk (< 4 KB) + question; answer persisted to DB table `qa_sessions`.
5. P95 latency for `/summaries` < 200 ms at 10 K rows.
6. OpenAPI docs auto-generated and served at `/docs`.
7. Unit tests mock DB & Gemini; integration test full happy-path `dlm ask`.

## Dev Notes
* Fastify framework: Use async/await patterns with proper error handling middleware
* JWT Authentication: jsonwebtoken npm package with secure token validation
* Database Integration: Reuse better-sqlite3 connection from Story 1.2 implementation
* Performance: Leverage Fastify's built-in request/response lifecycle optimization
* CLI Integration: yargs configuration sharing validation logic with REST endpoints

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. (AC 1) Scaffold Fastify app with listed routes; connect to SQLite database.
2. (AC 2) Build yargs CLI wrapping REST endpoints.
3. (AC 3) Implement JWT verification; document env var `DLM_TOKEN`.
4. (AC 4) Implement follow-up handler: assemble context, call Gemini, store in `qa_sessions`.
5. (AC 5) Benchmark with Artillery or autocannon; tune DB indices.
6. (AC 6) Expose OpenAPI with @fastify/swagger; ensure CI checks schema.
7. (AC 7) Add unit & integration tests with vitest.

## Project Structure Notes
Files introduced:
* `src/api.js` - Fastify server with OpenAPI documentation via @fastify/swagger
* `src/cli.js` - yargs CLI commands wrapping REST endpoints with shared validation
* `src/auth.js` - JWT middleware and token validation utilities  
* `src/qa.js` - Follow-up Q&A handler integrating with Gemini from Story 1.2

## Checklist Results
Pending execution of story-draft checklist.
