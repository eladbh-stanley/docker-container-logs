# 4. User Stories (Illustrative)
1. **As an SRE**, I can list containers and pick one emitting errors so I can focus summaries on it.
2. **As a developer**, I receive a one-line TL;DR every 30 s while coding so I avoid sifting through verbose logs.
3. **As an on-call engineer**, I ask _“why did payment-service crash at 02:15?”_ and get an answer within 10 s.
4. **As a security lead**, I rely on secrets redaction so credentials never leave the host.
5. **As a team lead**, I track Prometheus metrics to tune chunk size and cost.
